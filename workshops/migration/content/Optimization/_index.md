# Continual Optimization

In the cloud, it's important to look regularly and closely at how your applications and services are architected and utilized. It's the best way to identify opportunities that will let you right-size your instances.

In this Workshop, the CloudFormation Template provided automatically instrumented your Wordpress application and underlying host instance with New Relic's APM, Browser, and Infrastructure agents.  [Instrumentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/optimize-your-cloud-native-environment/optimize-cloud-architecture-spend-continuously-improve-your-modern-cloud-environment#instrument) is the first step in the ongoing effort to continually optimize your cloud environment.

# Cloud Optimize

New Relic offers a free, open source application named [Cloud Optimize](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/nr1-catalog.manager-launcher?launcher=eyJhY3RpdmVWaWV3IjoiZGV0YWlscyIsInBhY2thZ2VJZCI6IjdlODc0YjZlLWMwMTAtNDkzMy1hMTVkLWVhNWIyZTU0ZDAyOSIsInBhY2thZ2VOYW1lIjoiQ2xvdWQgT3B0aW1pemUifQ==) that compares the size of your instances to their utilization, identifying resources that are sized larger than needed. Cloud Optimize will estimate your savings by optimizing resource size.

Unlike other applications that charge a per host fee for this level of information, Cloud Optimize is free of charge for all New Relic customers.
