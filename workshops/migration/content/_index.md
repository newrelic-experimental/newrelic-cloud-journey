 * Wordpress
 * MySQL
 * New Relic's Infrastructure agent

* Create a [Workload](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/workloads/workloads-new-relic-one-isolate-resolve-incidents-faster) that includes the Wordpress application and its underlying host instance
* Migrate the Workload to a different AWS region
