# Congratulations!

You have successfully completed the New Relic Cloud Migration Workshop!  We hope that in doing so you have learned:

* Why instrumentation of your applications and hosts is important
* What Workloads in New Relic consist of and how they can be used to track cloud migration efforts using Nimbus
* How New Relic's Cloud Optimize application can be used to continually optimize your cloud environment

# Cleanup

To avoid any future costs, we recommend that you now visit the [US East 1 Stacks page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks?filteringText=&filteringStatus=active&viewNested=true&hideStacks=false) and the [US West 1 Stacks page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-west-1#/stacks?filteringText=&filteringStatus=active&viewNested=true&hideStacks=false) and delete the **New-Relic-Wordpress** stacks you created there.

# Thank You!

Thank you for taking the time to learn more about New Relic and how it can be used to accelerate cloud migrations.  You might also be interested in exploring our other workshops:
